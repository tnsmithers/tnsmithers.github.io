      <h3 style="text-align:center;color:darkred;">Brand Communications Student Assistant</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center;">Currently, I have what I consider to be the best internship at UW student could have. I work at Wisconsin Athletics as a Brand Communication Student Assistant. That's a fancy was of saying I help run social media and do wrting for the athletics website (<a href="https://www.uwbadgers.com">Visit uwbadgers.com</a>). I am specifically assigned women's hockey, and men's and women's golf, meaning those sports are my responsibility in addition to my supervisors who also "own" that sport. My favorite is women's hockey. They are historically successful and have had a really good season so far. My task for women's hockey has been the Tik Tok page and we have already gained <em><strong>over 1,000 followers</strong></em> since I started posting. I love my job!</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Some things I do at my job:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Write pregame stories</li>
        <li>Write postgame stories</li>
        <li>Film and edit videos for Tik Tok</li>
        <li>Upload photos for athletes on a platform called Opendorse and tag them</li>
        <li>Right releases for things like league awards</li>
        <li>Run the Twitter during hockey games and golf tournmanets</li>
      </ul>
