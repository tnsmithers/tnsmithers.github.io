      <h3 style="text-align:center;">About Ellie</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center;">Ellie is a guinea pig that I got when I graduated middle school in June of 2016. My guinea pig before her, named Pepsi, had passed away and I was devastated. One day, my dad and I brought home Ellie (without asking my mom of course) and our lives were never the same. She was the best guinea pig I could have asked for and she got me through high school, COVID, and part of college. Unfortunately, last month (September 2022), we had to put Ellie down. It was one of the hardest days of my life. However, I know that she lived a great life surrounded by a loving family. Here are some of my favorite pictures of her, though it was quite hard to pick just a few. </p>
